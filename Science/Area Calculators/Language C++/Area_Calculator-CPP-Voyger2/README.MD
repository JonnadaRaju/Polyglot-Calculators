# Project 
- A simple command-line tool written in [C++] to calculate the area of common geometric shapes: **rectangles**, **circles**, and **triangles**.

## Usage
- Calculates the area of a **Rectangle** (requires length and width).
- Calculates the area of a **Circle** (requires radius).
- Calculates the area of a **Triangle** (requires base and height).
- User-friendly interface for input.

## Format
- Select the shape depending on the alphabet assigned in front of it (Eg. a is for rectangle)
- Based on the shape enter the required value                                                                      

## Requirements
- Any C++ compiler works


## Error-Handling
    
                                                                      

### Compile the Code
Navigate to the directory containing `main.cpp` and use the C++ compiler (`g++`) to build the executable:
```
g++ main.cpp -o calculator
./calculator
```
